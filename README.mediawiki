= DW2 For Munin =

DaRWIN also stands for Data Research Warehouse Information Network.
This tool is used to manage your natural sciences collections

This repository contains some munin-node plugins to monitor
your darwin2 installation.

See  the main project page at 
[http://projects.naturalsciences.be/projects/darwin]
or
[https://github.com/naturalsciences/Darwin]


== Configuration ==

Link these files in your munin-node "plugins/" directory
of the DB server and add this configuration to your
munin-node config file.

[darwin_*]
  user postgres

You also need to "patch" a file from your std munin installation
to allow darwin plugins.
